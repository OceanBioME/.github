OceanBioME.jl is a flexible biogeochemical modelling environment written in Julia for modelling the coupled interactions between ocean biology, carbonate chemistry, and physics. 
OceanBioME can be run as a stand-alone box model, or coupled with Oceananigans.jl to run as a 1D column model or with 2 and 3D physics.

OceanBioME was developed with generous support from the Centre for Climate Repair CCR and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation as a tool to study the effectiveness and impacts of ocean carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies.

You can find the code for OceanBioME.jl in [this repo](https://github.com/OceanBioME/OceanBioME.jl), the documentation [here](https://oceanbiome.github.io/OceanBioME.jl/), and our JOSS paper describing the code [here](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05669).

If you would like to get in touch about using OceanBioME please [open a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/OceanBioME/discussions), or reach out to one of the contributors.
